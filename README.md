# PMPi3
Plex Media Player Pi i3

PMPi3 is either an SD card image or a script that turns your raspbian/raspberry pi os lite flashed raspberry pi into a plex media playing mini HTPC.
This project downloads and installs all of the required dependencies for https://github.com/plexinc/plex-media-player, installs the basic requirements for a desktop UI (using the i3 window manager), sets up autologin for the `pi` user and builds and installs plex media player directly from the Plex Inc. github repo.
